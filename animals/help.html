    <h3>Other Ways to Help: </h3>
    <p>Consider volunteering or donating to foundations such as the WWF. Additionally, take care of your local environment to prevent further extinction. If you see a sick or injured animal in New York City, call 411. If the animal is causing a threat to safety, call 911. Visit national parks, or donate to environmental charities. Don't purchase items (such as ivory or turtle shells) that come from endangered creatures. Finally, don't litter or pollute your local environment. Educate yourself about different species on our planet. </p>
